Haskell for Beginners — Extracted Code

Generated on 2025-09-19 UTC

This archive contains all code and command/session snippets extracted chapter-by-chapter from the book “Haskell for Beginners”.

File extensions are heuristic:

.hs → Haskell source code

.sh → shell/terminal commands

.ghci.txt → GHCi interactive transcripts

.txt → miscellaneous examples that look like code but aren’t clearly one of the above

Some inline examples may have been included as .txt if their language could not be determined with confidence.

Notes

Snippets are sequentially numbered (snippet_001, snippet_002, etc.) within each chapter.

If you want to compile or run them, copy the .hs files into your own project structure.

GHCi transcripts (.ghci.txt) are included for context but aren’t meant to be compiled directly.
